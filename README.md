# Stance Detection on “Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG)” Policy

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze **public stance toward “Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG)” policy** — a national free meal initiative introduced by the government.

Using **YouTube comments** as the primary data source, the project classifies public opinions into three stance categories:

- **FAVOR** — Supportive or positive stance toward MBG  
- **AGAINST** — Critical or negative stance toward MBG  
- **NEUTRAL** — Informative or unclear stance  

A fine-tuned **IndoBERT** model will be developed to automatically classify stances and provide insight into how Indonesian citizens respond to the MBG policy online.
